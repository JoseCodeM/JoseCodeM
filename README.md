- 👋 Hi, I’m @JoseCodeM Part-time student and part-time Uber Eats delivery driver!
- 👀 I’m interested in Lifting weights, working on cars with friends, watching anime, playing video games & of course learning how to program!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS, C++, Javascript! I'm Pursuing a Programming Certification at my local Community College.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any type of projects I can get my hands on! That's of course projects that I'm able to handle since I am still a noob at this. 
- 📫 You can reach me by email @ JoseCodeM@gmail.com
